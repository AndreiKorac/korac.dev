      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Andrei Korac, a Ryerson Computer Science alumnus and software developer in Toronto, Canada.
I graduated from Ryerson in the spring of 2019. In my time there, I got involved in student life by becoming an executive on my program&amp;rsquo;s course union, and participating in the school&amp;rsquo;s rugby club (since I graduated, they&amp;rsquo;ve formed a proper team!).
As a student I commuted from the suburbs of Mississauga, and now that I live and work in Toronto, I enjoy spending my free time exploring the city on my bike during the warmer months.</description>

      <description>Hello World! This site is finally up and running.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Hugo generated static site served using S3 and CloudFront with a CodeBuild webhook rebuilding the site when I push changes to the Github repo.
With exams starting within a week I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be smart to spend a couple of days bashing my head against AWS in an attempt to learn how to do all that instead of studying so I can graduate this spring.</description>
