Hello, I'm Andrei Korac, a software developer in Toronto, Canada.

I studied Computer Science at Ryerson University. In my time there, I got involved in student life by becoming an executive on my program's course union, and participating in the school's rugby club (since I graduated, they've formed a proper team - causing much FOMO on my part!).

As a student I commuted from the suburbs of Mississauga, and now that I live and work in Toronto, I enjoy spending my free time exploring the city on my bike during the warmer months. This has become my biggest outdoor hobby since covid hit, with me spending a lot of time running and biking around Toronto.

Having spent the better part of the last year on the streets of Toronto I've come to appreciate much more greatly how the form of the city informs how we live in and interact with the physical environment around us. And in the case of Toronto I often mean that in a disgruntled way having regularly recreated Mad Max with reckless drivers in overbuilt streets on my bike.
