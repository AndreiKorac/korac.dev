Hello, I'm Andrei Korac, a software developer in Toronto, Canada.

I studied Computer Science at Ryerson University. In my time there, I got involved in student life by becoming an executive on my program's [course union](https://ryecscu.com), and participating in the school's rugby club (since I graduated, they've formed a proper team! - causing much FOMO on my part!).

As a student I commuted from the suburbs of Mississauga, and now that I live and work in Toronto, I enjoy spending my free time exploring the city on my bike during the warmer months.
