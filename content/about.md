Hello, I'm Andrei Korac, a Ryerson Computer Science alumnus and software developer in Toronto, Canada.


I graduated from Ryerson in the spring of 2019 and in my time there, I was a part of the student life by becoming an executive on my program's [course union](https://ryecscu.com) and participating in the school's rugby club.

As a student I commuted from the suburbs of Mississauga, and now that I live and work in Toronto, I enjoy spending my free time exploring the city on my bike during the warmer months.
